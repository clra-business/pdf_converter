SOC 2 Type 2 Report - Structure | Architecture

- **Section I - Management Assertion:** A formal declaration from the service organization's management, confirming the scope of the audit and asserting that their system description is accurate and their controls are suitably designed.
    
- **Section II - Independent Service Auditor’s Opinion:** This is arguably the most critical section and the first place an analyst looks. It contains the auditor's final verdict, which falls into one of four categories:
    
    - **Unqualified:** The "gold standard" or a clean pass.
        
    - **Qualified:** A pass, but with specific exceptions or deficiencies noted.
        
    - **Adverse:** A failure; the controls are not operating effectively.
        
    - **Disclaimer of Opinion:** The auditor could not gather enough evidence to form an opinion.
        
- **Section III - System Description:** A detailed narrative describing the services, infrastructure, software, people, and processes that are in scope for the audit.
    
- **Section IV - Tests of Controls:** This is the longest and most granular section of the report. It is typically presented in a tabular or matrix format and contains the core evidence of the audit. For each control, it details:
    
    - The **Control Criterion** (e.g., CC1.1 from the Common Criteria).
        
    - The **Control Description** provided by the company.
        
    - The **Auditor's Test Procedure** used to validate the control.
        
    - The **Test Result**, which explicitly states whether the control was effective and details any **exceptions** found.
        
- **Section V - Other Information / Management’s Response (Optional):** If exceptions were noted in Section IV, this section provides a space for management to respond, for example, by describing their remediation plans.
