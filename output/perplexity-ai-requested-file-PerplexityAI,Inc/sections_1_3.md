that complementary subservice organization controls that are suitably designed and operating
effectively are necessary, along with controls at Perplexity AI, to achieve Perplexity AI’s service
commitments and system requirements based on the applicable trust services criteria. The description
presents Perplexity AI’s controls, the applicable trust services criteria and the types of complementary
subservice organization controls assumed in the design of Perplexity AI’s controls. The description does
not disclose the actual controls at the subservice organization. Our examination did not include the
services provided by the subservice organization, and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design
or operating effectiveness of such complementary subservice organization controls.


The description indicates that certain complementary user entity controls that are suitably designed and
operating effectively are necessary, along with controls at Perplexity AI, to achieve Perplexity AI’s
service commitments and system requirements based on the applicable trust services criteria. The
description presents Perplexity AI’s controls, the applicable trust services criteria and the
complementary user entity controls assumed in the design of Perplexity AI’s controls. Our examination
did not include such complementary user entity controls, and we have not evaluated the suitability of
the design or operating effectiveness of such controls.


**Service Organization’s Responsibilities**


Perplexity AI is responsible for its service commitments and system requirements and designing,
implementing, and operating effective controls within the system to provide reasonable assurance that
Perplexity AI’s service commitments and system requirements were achieved. In Section 2, Perplexity
AI has provided the accompanying assertion titled “Perplexity AI, Inc.’s Management Assertion”

(assertion) about the description and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls
stated therein. Perplexity AI is also responsible for preparing the description and assertion, including the
completeness, accuracy, and method of presentation of the description and assertion; providing the
services covered by the description; selecting the applicable trust services criteria, and stating the
related controls in the description; and identifying the risks that threaten the achievement of the service
organization’s service commitments and system requirements.


**Service Auditor’s Responsibilities**



Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the description and the suitability of design and operating
effectiveness of controls stated in the description based on our examination. Our examination was
conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform our examination to obtain

# clra.business@hotmail.com



We are required to be independent and meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement.



An examination of a description of a service organization’s system and the suitability of the design and
operating effectiveness of controls involves—


  obtaining an understanding of the system and the service organization’s service commitments
and system requirements.


  - assessing the risks that the description is not presented in accordance with the description
criteria and that controls were not suitably designed or did not operate effectively.


  performing procedures to obtain evidence about whether the description is presented in
accordance with the description criteria.


  performing procedures to obtain evidence about whether controls stated in the description were
suitably designed to provide reasonable assurance that the service organization achieved its
service commitments and system requirements based on the applicable trust services criteria.


  testing the operating effectiveness of controls stated in the description to provide reasonable
assurance that the service organization achieved its service commitments and system
requirements based on the applicable trust services criteria.


  evaluating the overall presentation of the description.


Our examination also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances.


**Inherent Limitations**


The description is prepared to meet the common needs of a broad range of report users and may not,
therefore, include every aspect of the system that individual report users may consider important to meet
their informational needs. There are inherent limitations in any system of internal control, including the


3


possibility of human error and the circumvention of controls. Because of their nature, controls may not
always operate effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the service organization’s service
commitments and system requirements are achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria.
Also, the projection to the future of any conclusions about the suitability of the design or operating
effectiveness of controls is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


**Emphasis of Matters – Controls Did Not Operate During the Period Covered by the Report**


The Service Organization’s description of the system discusses its electronic media disposal processes.
However, during the period March 1, 2024, to February 28, 2025, the service organization did not
perform a data disposal which would warrant the operation of the electronic media disposal process.
Because those controls did not operate during the period, we were unable to test, and did not test, the
operating effectiveness of those controls as evaluated using the following trust services criteria.


  - CC6.5, _The entity discontinues logical and physical protections over physical assets only after_
_the ability to read or recover data and software from those assets has been diminished and is_

Additionally, the Service Organization’s description of its system discusses its security incident response
and recovery processes. However, during the period March 1, 2024, to February 28, 2025, the Service
# Organization did not experience a security incident that would warrant the operation of the response  clra.business@hotmail.com

and recovery processes and controls within its security incident response and recovery plan. Because
those controls did not operate during the period, we were unable to test, and did not test, the operating
effectiveness of those controls as evaluated using the following trust services criteria:


  - CC7.4, _The entity responds to identified security incidents by executing a defined incident_
_response program to understand, contain, remediate, and communicate security incidents, as_
_appropriate._


  - CC7.5, _The entity identifies, develops, and implements activities to recover from identified_
_security incidents._


Our opinion is not modified with respect to the matters emphasized.

The Perplexity AI application infrastructure is located at AWS US-East data centers. AWS acts
as a hosting subservice organization for the company. The subservice organization provides the
physical security and environmental protection controls, as well as managed services for
Perplexity AI’s infrastructure.


AWS's network security uses hardware and software-based intrusion prevention, advanced
content filtering, anti-malware, and anti-spam modules.


In addition to the firewall, Perplexity AI uses anti-virus and anti-spyware applications to protect
systems from viruses.


Perplexity AI’s Information Security Policy and security procedures ensure that all computer
devices (including servers, desktops, printers, etc.) connected to the Perplexity AI network have
proper virus protection software, current virus definition libraries, and the most recent operating
system and security patches installed. The IT department verifies that all known and reasonable
defenses are in place to reduce network vulnerabilities while keeping the network operating. In
the event of a virus threat, the anti-virus system will attempt to delete or quarantine the infected
file. If the virus cannot be deleted or quarantined, the infected machine will be disconnected from
the network and cleaned manually.


Multiple controls are installed to monitor traffic that could contain malicious programs or code.
External perimeter scans are performed annually by a third-party vendor to expose potential
vulnerabilities to the production environment and corporate data. Email is scanned at the gateway
and in the hosted email environment. Server operating systems utilize anti-virus and anti-spyware

**Change Management**



For internally developed software platforms/solutions, Perplexity AI uses an agile-based SDLC
process, which includes research and planning, analysis and design, initial development, and
# clra.business@hotmail.com
quality assurance (QA) testing before the final release. All software development activities follow
the internal project-related business process model.



Perplexity AI has a Change Management Policy in place to control information resources that
require an outage for planned upgrades, maintenance, or fine-tuning. Additionally, unplanned
outages may occur that may result in upgrades, maintenance, or fine-tuning. The purpose of the
Change Management Policy is to manage changes in a rational and predictable manner so that
staff and clients can plan accordingly. Changes require forethought, monitoring, and follow-up
evaluation to reduce the negative impact on the user community and to increase the value of
Information Resources. The Perplexity AI Change Management Policy applies to all individuals
who install, operate, or maintain Information Resources.


**Patch Management**


Perplexity AI takes a proactive approach to patch management. The CTO and engineers regularly
monitor various websites, message boards, and mailing lists where advanced notifications of bugrelated patches are often disclosed prior to a public announcement by the vendor. This allows the
company to plan for upcoming patches.


The networking team reviews the availability of patches and independently determines if it is
necessary to deploy within the production environment. Approved patches are scheduled for
installation in the test environment weekly as applicable. If there are no issues in the test
environment after a week, the patch will be applied to the production environment. The patching
process is tracked via Linear ticket.

**Backup and Recovery**


Perplexity AI backup and recovery approach focuses on safeguarding user-generated data while
maintaining a single-region compute infrastructure.


In addition, Perplexity AI servers utilize daily full and incremental backups. The retention period
for these jobs is 30 days with a rotation period of seven (7) incremental backups and one full
backup job. Jobs are run nightly on a regular schedule with schedules distributed based on server
function. Emails are generated on job completion and reviews are completed daily with additional
monitoring via AWS CloudWatch and PagerDuty service alerts. Weekly backup summary emails
are also generated.


All backups are encrypted and stored onsite in the dedicated backup servers.


**Computer Operations**


Perplexity AI maintains an incident response plan to guide employees on reporting and
# Confidential
responding to any information security or data privacy events or incidents. Procedures are in place
for identifying, reporting, and acting upon breaches or other incidents.



Perplexity AI internally monitors all applications, including the web UI, databases, and cloud

internal SLA for responding to those issues.



**Problem Management**


Perplexity AI maintains an Incident Response Policy that describes the process for identifying and
addressing potential security incidents. The policy details what must occur if an incident is
suspected and covers electronic and physical security incidents. Plans for detecting, responding
to, and recovering from incidents are included in the policy and post-incident activity requirements
are defined. To ensure responsible employees are prepared to respond to incidents, the
organization provides formal security breach training.


The organization provides a customer service request form where clients can report potential
security breaches, and clients are also provided with an email and phone number for this same
purpose. Internal users are directed to report incidents through an internal portal for
documentation and tracking purposes.


**Data Communications**


Perplexity AI has elected to use a Cloud Service Provider to run its production infrastructure in
part to avoid the complexity of network monitoring, configuration, and operations.


AWS simplifies the company’s logical network configuration by providing an effective firewall
around all the Perplexity AI application containers, with the only ingress from the network via
HTTPS connections to designated web frontend endpoints.


17


AWS also automates the provisioning and deprovisioning of containers to match the desired
configuration; if an application container fails, it will be automatically replaced, regardless of
whether that failure is in the application or on underlying hardware.


**System Monitoring**


The Network Security and Vulnerability Management Policy describes the organization’s policies
and procedures related to network logging and monitoring as well as vulnerability identification
and remediation. The organization uses CloudWatch for system logging within the AWS
environment. CloudWatch and the firewall logs document source IP, destination IP, destination
port, protocol type, and timestamp. The organization monitors system capacity using AWS EKS
Autoscaling.


AWS GuardDuty is used for threat detection purposes, and the tool generates logs, VPC flow
logs, and DNS logs for intrusion detection.


# Confidential



The vulnerability assessment process involves the execution of CIS testing, implementation of
antivirus software, and system patching. The organization uses SentinelOne antivirus and has
configured the software to run updates daily and prohibit end-users from disabling or altering the
# software. Alerts are sent immediately when a potential virus is detected, and logs are generated and retained for at least one year with at least three months readily available. AWS GuardDuty  Visa Inc.

and AWS Inspector are used to identify newly emerging vulnerabilities, and the organization
monitors vendors for patch updates to correct vulnerabilities.

# Vendor Management  clra.business@hotmail.com



**Vendor Management**



The organization maintains a Vendor Management Policy that includes requirements for
interacting with vendors/service providers. The policy includes requirements for performing due
diligence measures prior to engaging with a new provider. Due diligence procedures include
evaluating each material IT vendor’s cost-effectiveness, functionality/services, risk, financial
viability, compliance, and performance. The organization is required to define service levels when
negotiating an arrangement with a new vendor or re-negotiating an existing arrangement, and all
service levels are agreed upon and documented clearly. The organization monitors its providers’
service levels to ensure each provider is providing the agreed-upon services and is compliant with
all requirements. The organization executes non-disclosure agreements with third parties before
any information is shared.


**RELEVANT ASPECTS OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT, RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS,**
**CONTROL ACTIVITIES, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION, AND MONITORING**


**CONTROL ENVIRONMENT**


The control environment is the set of standards, processes, and structures that provide the basis
for carrying out internal control across an organization. The organizational structure, separation
of job responsibilities by departments and business function, documentation of policies and
procedures, and internal audits are the methods used to define, implement, and assure effective
operational controls. The Board of Directors and/or senior management establish the tone at the
top regarding the importance of internal control and expected standards of conduct.


**Management Philosophy, Integrity, and Ethical Values**


18


Perplexity AI’s control environment reflects the philosophy of senior management concerning the
importance of the security of data. Integrity and ethical values are essential elements of Perplexity
AI’s control environment. Management is responsible for setting the tone at the top, establishing,
communicating, and monitoring control policies and procedures.


Formal policies, code of conduct, and employee handbooks are documented and communicated
to employees to ensure that entity values, ethics, integrity, and behavioral standards are a primary
focus, and risks are mitigated in daily operations. In addition, a sanctions policy is in place to
address deviations from established security and personnel standards.


Management’s philosophy and operating style affect the way the entity is managed, including the
kinds of business risks accepted. Perplexity AI places a great deal of importance on working to
ensure that the integrity of processing is a primary focus and that controls are maximized to
mitigate risk in daily operations. Management and specific teams are structured to ensure the
highest level of integrity and efficiency in customer support and transaction processing.


# Confidential



Formal job descriptions and departmental meetings and staff interactions ensure communication
of organizational values, ethics, and behavior standards. Personnel operates under Perplexity
AI’s policies and procedures, including confidentiality agreements and security policies. Annual
training is conducted to communicate regulations and the importance of privacy and security.

**Commitment to Competence**
# clra.business@hotmail.com



**Commitment to Competence**



Perplexity AI has standardized human resource policies and procedures. The result is a uniform
set of practices that provide equitable hiring and advancement opportunities across the
organization.


Training and development opportunities are provided to staff and performance evaluations are
performed to communicate goals based on job responsibilities and address any performance
issues.


Employees are trained in their specific roles and policies through on-the-job training and
procedures are reviewed. Management communicates any changes to these policies on an
ongoing basis and policies are updated as needed. In order to protect confidential internal and
client information employees are prohibited from divulging any information regarding client affairs
or taking an action, not in the interests of the client or Perplexity AI.


**Organizational Structure and Assignment of Authority and Responsibilities**


Perplexity AI's organizational structure provides the framework within which its activities for
achieving entity-wide objectives are planned, executed, controlled, and monitored. Management
believes establishing a relevant organizational structure includes considering key areas of
authority and responsibility. An organizational structure has been developed to suit its needs. This
organizational structure is based partly on its size and the nature of its activities.


Perplexity AI's assignment of authority and responsibility activities includes factors such as how
authority and responsibility for operating activities are assigned and how reporting relationships
and authorization hierarchies are established. It also includes policies relating to appropriate


19


business practices, knowledge, and experience of key personnel, and resources provided for
carrying out duties. In addition, it includes policies and communications directed at ensuring
personnel understand the entity’s objectives, know how their actions interrelate and contribute to
those objectives, and recognize how and for what they will be held accountable.


Specific control activities that the service organization has implemented in this area are described
below:


  - Organizational charts are in place to communicate key areas of authority and
responsibility.


  - Organizational charts are communicated to employees and updated as needed.


**Human Resources Policies and Procedures**


Perplexity AI has formal hiring procedures that are designed to ensure that new team members
can meet or exceed the job requirements and responsibilities. All candidates go through
interviews and assessments of their education, professional experience, and certifications.
# Confidential
Background checks are performed for all newly hired employees before the start date and include
a review of their education and criminal records.
# During the onboarding process, the new employees review the Employee Handbook, Code of  Visa Inc.

Conduct, and any other relevant policies and procedures relevant to their role. Newly hired
employees are required to sign an acknowledgment of receipt and understanding of the Employee
Handbook and Code of Conduct. These policies and procedures are also available to employees
# through the internal policies repository. Security awareness training is also completed at least  clra.business@hotmail.com

annually by all employees, including the areas of security and confidentiality, to communicate the
security implications around their roles and how their actions could affect the organization.


Ongoing performance feedback is provided to all employees and contractors. Formal
performance reviews are completed annually by management to discuss expectations, goals, and
the employees’ performance for the last fiscal year.


**RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS**


Perplexity AI regularly reviews the risks that may threaten the achievement of its service
commitments and system requirements related to security and confidentiality. The Risk
assessment process is performed by management to identify and manage risks and consider
possible changes in the internal and external environment to mitigate these risks. Risk mitigation
activities include the prevention, mitigation, and detection of risk via the implementation of internal
controls. In addition, management also transfers risk through the organization’s business
insurance policies.


The Perplexity AI management team and other members of the engineering team monitor risk on
an ongoing basis using information derived from employee input, system morning, audit results,
industry experience, business environment, and internal system and/or process changes.


On an annual basis, management completes a risk assessment as part of the annual risk
management activities. Risks identified during the annual risk assessment process include the
following:


20


  - Operational Risk


  - Strategic Risk


  - Compliance Risk


  - Fraud Rise


  - Environmental Risk


**Integration with Risk Assessment**


The environment in which the system operates; the commitments, agreements, and
responsibilities of Perplexity AI’s system; as well as the nature of the components of the system
result in risks that the criteria will not be met. Perplexity AI addresses these risks through the
implementation of suitably designed controls to provide reasonable assurance that the criteria are
met. Because each system and the environment in which it operates are unique, the combination
of risks to meet the criteria and the controls necessary to address the risks will be unique. As part
# of the design and operation of the system, Perplexity AI’s management identifies the specific risks that the criteria will not be met and the controls necessary to address those risks. Confidential



**CONTROL ACTIVITIES**


# Visa Inc.

Control activities are the actions established by policies and procedures to help ensure that
management directives to mitigate risks to the achievement of objectives are executed. Control
activities are performed at all levels of the organization and various stages within business
processes, and over the technology environment.

processes, and over the technology environment.



**INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM**


Perplexity AI has an information security policy to help ensure that employees understand their
roles and responsibilities concerning processing and controls to ensure significant events are
communicated in a timely manner. These include formal and informal training programs and the
use of email to communicate time-sensitive information and processes for security and
confidentiality purposes that notify the key personnel in the event of problems.


Additional communication methods include department meetings to communicate company
policies, procedures, industry or business issues, or other topics management deems key to the
achievement of the organization’s objectives. Communication is encouraged at all levels to
promote the operating efficiency of Perplexity AI.


Perplexity AI also updates its website on an ongoing basis to inform clients and other external
parties of company and industry-related issues that could affect its services and what steps the
company is taking to reduce or avoid the impact on their operations. The organization’s security
and confidentiality commitments regarding the Text Generation and Information Retrieval
services system are included in the services agreement.


**MONITORING CONTROLS**


In addition to daily oversight and vulnerability assessments, management uses monitoring
software to monitor the security and confidentiality of their systems. Ongoing monitoring of internal
controls is also performed by management.


21


**Ongoing Monitoring**


Perplexity AI uses a subservice organization to provide hosting services.


The management of Perplexity AI receives and reviews the SOC 2 report of AWS on an annual
basis. In addition, through its daily operational activities, the management of Perplexity AI
monitors the services performed by AWS to ensure that operations and controls expected to be
implemented at the subservice organization are functioning effectively.


**TRUST SERVICES CATEGORIES**


The Security, Availability and Confidentiality categories and applicable trust services criteria were
used to evaluate the suitability of the design of controls stated in the description. Criteria and
controls designed, implemented, and operated to meet them ensure that information, systems,
and access (physical and logical) are protected against unauthorized access, and systems are
available for operation and use.
# Confidential

**CONTROL ACTIVITIES AND CRITERIA**


The Company’s trust services criteria and related control activities are included in Section 4 of
# Visa Inc.
this report to eliminate the redundancies that would result from listing them here in Section 3 and
repeating them in Section 4. Although the trust services criteria and related control activities are
included in Section 4, they are, nevertheless, an integral part of Perplexity AI’s description of

controls.
# clra.business@hotmail.com


For specific criteria, that were deemed not relevant to the system, see Section 4 for the related
explanation.


**CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM DURING THE PERIOD**


No significant changes have occurred to the services provided to user entities during the
examination period.
