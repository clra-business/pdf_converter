1.  First, ask the user for two things:
    - The path to the file they want to refactor.
    - The specific goal of the refactor (e.g., "improve readability," "increase performance of the `_parse_controls` function," "extract this class to its own file").

2.  Analyze the code and formulate a detailed, step-by-step refactoring plan.

3.  Present this plan to the user for approval. **CRITICAL: Do not proceed until you receive explicit approval for the plan.**

4.  Once the plan is approved, execute the refactoring exactly as outlined in the plan you created. Ensure all changes adhere to the project's `claude.md`.
