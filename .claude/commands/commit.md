1.  First, analyze the currently staged changes using `git diff --staged`.

2.  Based on the changes, determine the appropriate commit type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`).

3.  Write a concise and descriptive subject line (under 50 characters).

4.  Write a body for the commit message that explains the "what" and "why" of the changes in a few bullet points.

5.  Present the complete, formatted commit message to the user for approval. Explain the structure (e.g., "The `feat:` prefix means this is a new feature.").

6.  If the user approves, execute the `git commit` command with the generated message.
